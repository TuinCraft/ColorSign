[FUN] ColorSign - Switch sign text color through mousewheel scroll [493]
========================================================================

This is a simple plugin to let you switch the color of the text on a sign.
The idea was taken from Edward Hand's 
[PaintingSwitcher](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/edit-paintingswitch-v0-1-choose-paintings-with-ease-432.5788/).

It's really simple:
-------------

  * Place a sign with some text.
  * Target it with your mouse.
  * Scroll up or down to switch colors.
